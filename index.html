  <h3 class="text-center">The palace of the Oba of Benin (EGUAE OBA N'EDO)</h3>
  <p>The Royal Palace of Oba of Benin is a celebration and preservation of the rich Benin culture. Palace of Oba of Benin is mostly visited by Curators, Archaeologist and historians. It is large and square and surrounded by a wall. The court is divided into many palaces with separate houses and apartments for courtiers. The court has many galleries flanked by wooden pillars. Fixed to these pillars are shining metal plaques showing battle scenes and deeds of courage. The roofs of the palace have pointed turrets and on top of each turret there is a copper bird with outspread wings.</p>

  <p>The Royal Palace Of Oba Of Benin is a UNESCO listed heritage site. It is notable as the home of the Oba of Benin and other royals. The palace, built by Oba Ewedo (1255AD – 1280AD), is located at the heart of ancient City of Benin. It was rebuilt by Oba Eweka II (1914–1932) after the 1897 war with the British it was destroyed. The palace was declared a UNESCO Listed Heritage Site in 1999.</p>

  <h2 class="text-center">HISTORY</h2>
  <p>The Oba’s palace (Eguae Oba) today, is one of the testimonies of the political status of great Benin. It sits conspicuously right in the heart of the city, bounded in the north by king-square (Eko Oha/Unuoghua) and Unuabere, on the south by Ogbe-Ezoti, on the east by Ogbe N’Alaka and on the west by ekiokpagha (or sokponba). The palace has been the home of past and present Obas of Benin and each reigning monarch has left his influence there.</p>

  <figcaption>The outer gate of the oba palace.</figcaption>
  <br>
  <p>During the reign of the Ogiso (the kings of the sky), the palace was at Ugbekun, which is about six kilometre east of Benin. The site of the first palace, now a national monument, was built about A.D 904 by one of the Ogisos named Igodo. Thirty-six years later, his successor Ere, moved the palace to Uhunmwun/Idunmwun (now called east circular) where it remained until about A.D. 1170.</p>

  <p>When the last Ogiso Owodo, was banished from the throne for mal-administration, and during the interregnum which followed, Evian who was the administrator refused to live in the palace. Thus the neglected palace lost some of its attraction and greatness.</p>

  <p>A new palace was built however, at Usama (siluko road) about 1170 for Oranmiyan (Omonoyan) who at the request of the Binis, was sent from Ife by his father, Izoduwa, the grandson of Owodo the last Ogiso of Benin. He however refused to use this new palace, but his son Eweka I Later used it (c 1200).</p>

  <p>Two Obas of Benin, Uwakhuahen and Ehenmihen, also lived in this palace after the passing away of Eweka I. But because of persistent harassment from the Uzama (the king makers) who claimed equal powers with the Oba. Ewedo the eldest son of Ehenmihen, who succeeded to the throne, moved the palace from Usama – which is now only used as one of the shrines during coronation ceremonies.</p>

  <p>About 1816, the second son of Obanosa usurped the throne for eight months. In the civil war that ensued, Ogbebo was vanquished and in despair, he built down the palace and hanged himself. The same year, the palace was rebuilt by Osemwende, but part of it was destroyed in 1897 during the British punitive expedition to Benin.</p>


  <p>Although the palace has  changed considerably in appearance from what it looked like at the turn of the century, it still retains its old traditionaland architectural value and beauty.</p> 

  <p><span style="color:red; font-style: italic;">PLEASE NOTE that most of the descriptions of the Oba palace on this webpage is from the book: EGUAE OBA N'EDO published in 1979 by Osemwegie Ebohon with little modifications to suit present realities anywhere possible.</span></p>

  <p>The palace comprises (at least) of:</p>

  <h3>THE PALACE WALLS</h3>
  <p>The palace walls were made from the Benin red soil (Ulakpa). Instead of using water to mix the mud for setting the walls, palm oil was used.</p>

  <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="http://grottoafrique.com/oba4.jpg" height="200%" width="200%">

  <p>The walls are between two to four feet thick. One of the intriguing feature that has made the walls of the palace baffle modern architecture is that despite age and weather conditions they have gone through, no part has cracked.</p> 

  <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="http://grottoafrique.com/oba6.jpg" height="200%" width="200%"> 

  <ul>
    <li>The royal court yard which consists of:
      <ul>
        <li>The mud walls and brick concrete  foences around the palace.</li>
        <li>The ugherhoba (hall of departed obas).</li>
        <li>Ugha ehengbuda.</li>
        <li>Ugha ohuan.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Iwowa</em>; is a building none is allowed to talk about it stands lonely at the left entrance of the palace.</li>
    <li><em> Urho-ike</em>; here the lame porters (ike) guarding the erie (harem) resided.</li>
    <li>Iweribo (iwenekhuan).</li>
    <li>Aro-ozolua. </li>
    <li>Modern brick  buildings which serve as offices, visitors' waiting room, etc.</li>
    <li>Halls or room not accessible  to the public execpt for the initited member of the palace e.g. ugha n'ibiwe, iwori, ughe n'iwehuae, ugha ewase, iweoghene etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ERIE (HAREM):</h3>
  <p>This is where the Iloi (oba's wives, 'Oloi' singular) live in the palace. It formerly consisted of ten quarters but only a few of the quarters remain today. The doors leading there are guarded by Ogherienoguan (eunuchs). The Oko (hair apparent to the throne) is completely forbidden to enter here, but the Okoros (princes) at early age. Uvbis (princesses) can enter. Any reigning Oba has the prerogative to relax anywhere that suit him and his children.</p>

  <h3>UGHA-ERHA-OBA (UGHERHOBA):</h3>
  <p>This is the largest hall in the palace. It was built by Eweka II. Here the Erinmwindu (the ancestral shrine of the obas are housed). Other noteworthy shrines at Ugherhoba are shrines to immortalize great obas such as Adolo, Ovoranramwen and Eweka II. These shrines have invaluable tusks, bronzes and wood carvings which date back to the 11th century.</p>


<h3>ARO-ENIKAO:</h3>

  <figcaption>Palace ancestral shrine-1.</figcaption>
  <br>
<p>Every reigning Oba has the Ukhurhe (the traditional staff). There are 36 such staff preserved here. Oro and Ugigun festivals as wells as the marriages of princesses are performed here.</p>

  <figcaption>The outer gate of the oba palace.</figcaption>
  <br>
<p>On approaching the palace, there are two main gates with a four-foot wall built around them. The wall which was originally sixteen feet high and four feet thick, was destroyed during the British war with the Benin empire, but was rebuilt in brick by Akenzua II.</p> 

<img class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="British invasion of Benin" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/9c/6e/20/9c6e207383ab0f34f7875ddfe8724f06.jpg" height="200%" width="200%"> 
  <figcaption>British invasion of Benin.</figcaption>
  <br>

<p>Before the events of 1897 (the war) which left a lasting mark on great Benin kingdom, there used to be nine gates leading to the palace. Some have been protected for ceremonial purposes.</p>

  <br>

<h3>THE URHO-IWEBO (right gate):</h3>
<p>Opposite local government ministry of works was initially restricted to the use of the Ogbe and forbidden to women. It could be used by anybody now, except at ceremonial times.</p>

  <figcaption>Old traditional gate in the palace.</figcaption>
  <br>

<h3>URHOKPERE (left gate):</h3>
<p>By the left gate stands the statue of Ozolua, created by the Late Chief O. Idah. The Emobo ceremony used to be performed here. On this side of the gate, are also some tall Ikhimwin (new boulder trees). The Edion-Edo shrine is adjacent to the new boulder trees.</p>

<p><span style="color:red; font-style: italic;">NB: the gates are being described when approaching the palace from ring road. And they lead to an open ground  (field) in front of the palace where festivals and other ceremonies are performed.</span></p>

<p>The palace has various chambers and rooms that are closed to the public irrespective of their status. Invaluable items dating back to the 13th century are also stored here.</p>

<h3>MEMBERS OF THE PALACE.</h3>
<ul> 
<li>The Oba (Ewuare II presently).</li>

NB: Between A.D 1200 to A.D 1816 three ambitious princes, usurped the Benin throne. By tradition they cannot be recorded on the shrines. This note is to explain why some accounts may say a total of 40 Obas have ruled Benin.

<li>The Iloi (Oba’s wives); they were given titles, some representing parts of the body of the Oba etc, such as Eson, Ohan, Ehi, Egbe, Aro etc.</li>

<li>The Omada Oloi/Evien Oloi/Ighibierie (Queen’s maids).</li>
<li>The Okoro(s) – princess.</li>
<li>The Uvbi – princesses.</li>
<li>The Omada/Emada – royal scimitar bearer(s).</li>
<li>The Ibierughas – oba’s personal attendants, and</li>
<li>The Urhonisen (outdoor messengers).</li>
</ul>


<h3>SOME QUALIFICATIONS FOR INITIATION INTO EGUAE OBA N’EDO.</h3>
<ul>
<li>He must be sane.</li>
<li>he should be free of:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>infectious diseases.</li>
   <li>contagious diseases.</li>
   <li>any deadly disease.</li>
  </ul>
<li>He should not be a descendant of any families forbidden to enter the palace or move freely with the free citizens.</li>
<li>He must not be an enemy of the oba (Oghian -oba).</li>
<li>A naturalized Bini. (i.e. an acceptable foreigner that had proved himself worthy to gain a Bini citizenship and chieftaincy title from the Oba of Benin – e.g. Elaba (Esigie) title.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SOME PALACE TABOOS.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A Bini without the traditional marks could not take a chieftaincy title and no person could be made a chief while his father was still alive. Since about 1929, a Benin without tattoo could become a chief.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden for a woman who is not an Oloi (Oba’s wife) or Uvbi (princess) to touch the oba. If the oba is touched by a woman accidentally, she becomes his wife. If the oba does not want her as wife, the woman was then betrothed to a chief or any subject of his choice. Since 1933, the oba in a few cases waved this by shaking a woman.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to wear “polluted” clothes to the palace, and no subject may enter the palace after having intercourse and has not taken his bath.</li>

    <li> It was forbidden for the ‘Emuada’ to wear clothes. They do not touch any woman during their term of office in the palace which lasted up to the ages of eighteen and thirty from infancy. Some Emuada, of course served for life. One other feature that signaled the Emuada out from the rest of the inhabitant pf the palace is that they could not grow hair in any part of their body.</li>

    <li> The Edaiken (heir-apparent to the throne) can not live in the palace while the oba, his father was still alive.</li>

    <li>It was forbidden for any of the Oloi to touch any male child other than her own. If a baby boy urinates on the ground, water is pour on it or sputter is spat on it, because it is forbidden for a queen to step over it. They cannot touch any adult male and they cannot be touched by any adult male.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to whistle in the palace.</li>

    <li>Queens, chief, messengers and royal Omuada (scimitar bearer) cannot be initiated into the palace without the oath of allegiance to the oba.</li>

    <li>No person going into the harem should refuse a search by the lame guard and the eunuchs that guard the harem gates (between the outer and inner most). (NB: chief Oshodin takes care of the royal harem).</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to whistle in the palace.</li>

    <li>When greeting the Oba of Benin or talking to him, by tradition you must kneel down. Only native doctors, priests and priestesses do not kneel down while greeting the oba, but prostrate lying with the belly on ground. When they want to talk to him they sit on a mat on the floor.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to stand near the oba while talking to him or saluting him. The person must stand at a distance of at least two metres away. The courtiers who are not forbidden to go near him must cover their mouths with the palm or piece of clean white cloth.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to say the king is sleeping. You can only say “Ekpen re irhu” - meaning <em>the leopard is in the shelter</em>.</li>

    <li>To the Binis, the Oba of Benin is like a god and he is, thereafter not addressed as if he were mortal. For this reason, several figurative expression are used to convey his sickness, passing away, internment and burial (Emwinekhua). It is an abomination to think or say that he is dead, for the OBA OF BENIN NEVER DIES.</li>
</ul>


<h3>THE LANGUAGE OF THE PALACE.</h3>
<p>There is a palace language. And there is a language for each palace society/group. These are different from the one spoken by the Binis in general. But the oba understands all, although it may not be compulsory for all the chiefs and other members of the palace to hear all. Only his group/society’s own is compulsory to him or her.</p>
